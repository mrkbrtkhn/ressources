# WIlsON

WIlsON is an interactive workbench for analysis and visualization of multi-omics data developed at the MPI in Mario Looso's group. It is primarily intended to empower screening platforms to offer access to pre-calculated HT screen results to the non-computational scientist. Facilitated by an open file format, WIlsON supports all types of omics screens, serves results via a web-based dashboard, and enables end users to perform analyses and generate publication-ready plots.

# Nf-Core

The nf-core framework has been developed as a means for the development of collaborative, peer-reviewed, best-practice analysis pipelines. All nf-core pipelines are written in Nextflow and so inherit the ability to be executed on most computational infrastructures, as well as having native support for container technologies such as Docker and Singularity.
