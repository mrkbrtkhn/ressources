# WIlsON
WIlsON is an interactive workbench for analysis and visualization of multi-omics data. It is primarily intended to empower screening platforms to offer access to pre-calculated HT screen results to the non-computational scientist. Facilitated by an open file format, WIlsON supports all types of omics screens, serves results via a web-based dashboard, and enables end users to perform analyses and generate publication-ready plots.
