## DESeq2 and linear models

## Nf-Core

The nf-core framework has been developed as a means for the development of collaborative, peer-reviewed, best-practice analysis pipelines. All nf-core pipelines are written in Nextflow and so inherit the ability to be executed on most computational infrastructures, as well as having native support for container technologies such as Docker and Singularity.

## Mutect2

Calls somatic short mutations via local assembly of haplotypes. Short mutations include single nucleotide (SNA) and insertion and deletion (indel) alterations. The caller uses a Bayesian somatic genotyping model that differs from the original MuTect by Cibulskis et al., 2013 and uses the assembly-based machinery of HaplotypeCaller. Of note, Mutect2 v4.1.0.0 onwards enables joint analysis of multiple samples.
